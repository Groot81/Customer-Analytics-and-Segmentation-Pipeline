# Customer Analytics and Segmentation Pipeline

This project is a Python-based pipeline designed for customer data analysis, exploratory data visualization, lookalike modeling, and customer segmentation using clustering techniques. The project leverages pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn to provide insights into customer behaviors and patterns.

## Features

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**:
   - Loads customer, product, and transaction datasets from CSV files.
   - Cleans the data by checking for missing values and removing duplicates.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizes customer region distribution and product category distribution.
   - Generates a monthly sales trend using transaction data.

3. **Lookalike Model**:
   - Identifies customers with similar profiles based on transaction data.
   - Calculates similarity using cosine similarity and provides a CSV output of top lookalike customers.

4. **Customer Clustering**:
   - Groups customers into clusters using the KMeans algorithm.
   - Normalizes data and evaluates clusters using metrics like the Davies-Bouldin Index.
   - Visualizes customer clusters for better insights.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## File Structure

- **Customers.csv**: Contains customer details such as `CustomerID`, `Region`, etc.
- **Products.csv**: Contains product details such as `ProductID`, `Category`, etc.
- **Transactions.csv**: Contains transaction data including `CustomerID`, `TransactionDate`, `TotalValue`, etc.
- **Lookalike.csv**: Output file generated by the lookalike model containing similar customers.
- **Python Script**: Main script containing the pipeline code.

## How to Run

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. **Place the CSV files**:
   Ensure the files `Customers.csv`, `Products.csv`, and `Transactions.csv` are in the same directory as the script.

3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Output**:
   - Visualizations for EDA will open as plots.
   - A `Lookalike.csv` file will be created containing customer similarity data.
   - Clustering results will be displayed as a scatterplot.

## Customization

- Adjust the number of clusters in the KMeans algorithm by changing `n_clusters` in the `clustering` function.
- Modify the lookalike model to include additional features from the dataset.
- Extend EDA to include more visualizations.
